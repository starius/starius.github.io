My name is Boris Nagaev. I live in Moscow, Russia.
I program in C++, Lua and other. I use nickname starius.
My current position is PhD student at [Faculty of
Bioengineering and Bioinformatics][fbb]
of Lomonosov Moscow State University and software developer

In Moscow State University I'm working on algorithms

You can find other projects on [this page][code] and my
