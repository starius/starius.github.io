title: NPG-explorer 0.4.0 released
---

NPG-explorer is a new tool for nucleotide pangenome
construction and analysis of closely related prokaryotic
genomes.

[Version 0.4.0][0.4.0] was released on Jun 12, 2015.

This release has a focus on new developments and a few
bug fixes.

Changes:

  * Change alignment requirements. Require high similarity in
      every slice of length `MIN_LENGTH`. Use logarithmic
      gap penalty. Introduce option `MIN_END`. Do not require
      length of fragment >= `MIN_LENGTH`.
  * Short blocks of one fragment are now called minor blocks.
      All minor blocks are shorter than `MIN_LENGTH`.
  * GUI/BSA: show block's length for global blocks.
  * Use Travis CI: https://travis-ci.org/npge/npge
  * BlockSet alignment: g-blocks and i-blocks. G-blocks
      are formed from joined consequent s-blocks. S-blocks
      are always aligned in g-blocks. Other blocks form
      i-blocks.
  * Speed up SplitRepeats. Improve time complexity by
      building the tree from diagnostic positions. Critical
      for blocks of > 500 fragments.
  * PostProcessing produces new files:
      * table of global blocks' properties (`*.gbi`)
      * blockset alignments with block names (`*.blocks`)
      * pangenome-small.bi
      * nj-global-tree-full.tre
      * genes/partition.tsv
  * Mutations file parser written in Python (example)
  * Print local time with timezone offset to logs
  * Add descriptions of some algorithms (`*.md files`)
  * Translate ECCB'14 abstract into Russian
  * Fix bugs:
      * Fix bugs in GUI
      * Fix bugs in annotations parser (GetData)
      * Fix bugs in local blockset alignment builder. It
          used to consider linear sequences to be circular.
